This repository holds all the Problem Sets I solved as I took MIT's [6.100L: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (Fall 2022)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2022/).

## üß© PSET 1

We had to write a script which can determine, based on your income and other factors, the number of months it will take for you to save up for a down payment for a house. We also had to find the optimal interest rate in which we could afford the down payment of a house within three years.

**Learning Outcomes ‚Äì**
- Introduction to control flow in Python
- Formulating a computational solution to a problem
- Exploring bisection search

## üïπÔ∏è PSET 2

I had to recreate the popular hangman game in Python. Read a list of words from a file, created helper functions, and simulated a full hangman game against the computer. Implemented a hint functionality in the game as well which can give the user a letter of the word in exchange for number of attempts.

**Learning Outcomes ‚Äì**
- Writing and calling functions in Python
- Using loop mechanisms to repeat a computational process until a condition is reached

## üìä PSET 3

I had to write a program that analyzes and compares two text files using word and letter frequency statistics. It calculates similarity scores, identifies the most frequent words, and computes TF-IDF values to evaluate word significance across multiple documents.

**Learning Outcomes ‚Äì**
- Using dictionaries to efficiently store, update and manage data
- Exploring and understanding various data analytics approaches such as TF-IDF

## üå≤ PSET 4

This problem set focused on **recursion**, **tree data structures**, and **encryption using one-time pads**. It was divided into three parts:

- **Part A:** Involved working with binary trees. I used a `Node` class to construct and traverse trees recursively. Implemented a function to calculate the height of a tree and created a generalized heap validator that could check for both min-heaps and max-heaps using a comparator function.

- **Part B:** Introduced object-oriented programming in Python. I built a message encryption system using ASCII character shifting and implemented encryption via one-time pads. This involved writing classes for `Message`, `PlaintextMessage`, and `EncryptedMessage` with appropriate class methods for shifting, applying pads, and encrypting text.

- **Part C:** Extended the encryption logic to decrypt messages when given multiple possible one-time pads. I implemented a method to try all pads and determine which one yields the most valid English words, using a provided dictionary and helper functions. This part concluded with decrypting a hidden story.

**Learning Outcomes ‚Äì**
- Practicing recursion through tree traversal and manipulation
- Implementing class hierarchies with inheritance and encapsulation
- Applying character encoding principles using ASCII values
- Strengthening understanding of encryption/decryption fundamentals
- Performing brute-force decryption using heuristic scoring with real words
