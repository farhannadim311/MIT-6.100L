# MIT-6.100L
## Introduction to CS and Programming Using Python
This repository holds all the Problem Sets, I solved as I took MIT's intro to CS Course

# A brief description of the PSETS
## PSET 1 
We had to write a script which can determine based on your income and other factors, the number of months it will take for you to save up for a down payment for a house. We also had to find the optimal interest rate in which we could afford the down payment of a house within three years.
## Learning Outcomes -
    Introduction to control flow in Python
    Formulating a computational solution to a problem
    Exploring bisection search
## PSET 2
I had to recreate the popular hangman game in Python. Read a list of words from a file, created helper functions and simulated a full hangman game against the computer. Implemented a hint functionality in the game as well which can give the user a letter of the word in exchange for number of attempts
## Learning Outcomes -
    Writing and calling functions in Python
    Using loop mechanisms to repeat a computational process until a condition is reached
## PSET 3
I had to write a program that analyzes and compares two text files using word and letter frequency statistics. It calculates similarity scores, identifies the most frequent words, and computes TF-IDF values to evaluate word significance across multiple documents
## Learning Outcomes - 
    Using dictionaries to efficiently store, update and manage data
    Exploring and understanding various data analytics approach such as TF-IDF
